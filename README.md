Wordpress-Kersnippets
=====================

Little samplings of the Wordpress work I've done. Just the special templates, pages, etc.

This selection is meant to show a progression: 

#Old school work
This is work done when I first started working with Wordpress in 2009. Also, some training collateral I made to train students on using the back end.

#Project 1
This was a commercial project. Made some customization for them in the database and also hacked some WooCommerce in there, as well.

#Project 2
Another commercial project with a custom front.
